## Description

In this challenge, I will create a two-page personal blog website for marketing students. The blog site will allow users to input and view blog posts, showcasing their thoughts and experiences. The landing page will feature a form for entering a username, blog title, and content. Upon submission, the blog post data will be stored in localStorage. Users will be redirected to the posts page, where they can view a list of blog posts pulled from localStorage. The posts page will include a header with a light/dark mode toggle and a "Back" button for navigation. Additionally, users will be able to view a JSON array of blog post objects in localStorage, with details such as the post author's username, title, and content. Each blog entry will display the title, content, and author. The footer will contain a link to the developer's portfolio.

## Technologies Used
The technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.

## Installation
To install and work on the challenge, you will need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. You can create the project structure with an index.html file for the landing page, a posts.html file for the posts page, and separate CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

To set up the project, you can create a new folder for the challenge, open it in your code editor, and create the necessary files mentioned above. You can then start coding the landing page with the form for username, blog title, and content. Implement JavaScript functionality to store blog post data in localStorage upon form submission.

Next, create the posts page where users can view the blog posts pulled from localStorage. Add a header with a light/dark mode toggle and a "Back" button for navigation. Ensure that the styles update based on the selected mode.

Remember to test the form submission, localStorage functionality, and page navigation to ensure everything works as expected. Finally, include the JSON array of blog post objects in localStorage and display the blog entries with their respective details.

By following these installation instructions and utilizing the mentioned technologies, you can successfully complete Challenge 4 of the full stack application development course.
