# myFirstBlog
I created a two-page website to post using user input and comments. It inlcudes a content form, rendering blog posts stored in localstorage, and implenting a light/dark mode toggle.

I have also included a next page button that redirects to the home page.

this is one of many attempts to create a personal blog website
