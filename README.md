## Description
One of the most crucial skills I need to master as a web developer is the ability to read and write documentation. Often, I will be tasked with building a web application that meets specific requirements. To succeed in this task, I need to read documentation to understand how to use the technologies required to build the application. In this Challenge, I will demonstrate my ability to do just that by creating a two-page blog site.  Web APIs Challenge: Personal Blog In this challenge, I will create a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. It involves building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. As I code, I will gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the power of the Document Object Model, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.
